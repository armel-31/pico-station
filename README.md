# pico-station

The aim of this project is to propose open code in C for the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html), to integrate several environnemental sensors from Pimoroni :

| Sensor Name | Description |Â Dev Progress | Link  |
| :---:   | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| BME680 |  | OK |  |
| VL53L1X |  | OK |  |
| SGP30 |  | OK |  |

The rig used for testing is the [Pico Explorer Base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-explorer-base?variant=32369514315859) from Pimoroni.
