# pico-station

The aim of this project is to propose open code in C for the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html), to integrate several environnemental sensors from Pimoroni :

| Sensor Name | Description |Â Dev Progress |
| :---:   | :-: | :-: |
| [BME680](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/bme680-breakout?variant=12491552129107) | Air Quality, Temperature, Pressure, Humidity Sensor | OK |
| [VL53L1X](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/vl53l1x-breakout?variant=12628497236051) | Time of Flight (ToF) Sensor Breakout | OK |
| [SGP30](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/sgp30-air-quality-sensor-breakout?variant=30924091719763) | Air Quality Sensor Breakout | OK |

The rig used for testing is the [Pico Explorer Base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-explorer-base?variant=32369514315859) from Pimoroni. The ST7789 display will be used to check values of sensors.
